## Team Contract (rnbhat2-mcchan3-yihanwu4-sbalisi2)

### Communication



1. **Team Meetings** : Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 5-6 PM using Zoom. All of us will discuss the talking points for the respective stage in the project. Zoom meetings will be hosted by rnbhat2.
2. **Assistance** : Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord, or Messenger. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 24 hours. 
3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the "project lead" for the weekly meeting.
   Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion
   about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous 
   agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions 
   made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary tasks for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more tasks. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. 
2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than seven hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation, further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members. 
3. **Conflict Resolution** We do not expect there to be too many conflicts (since most of us are on the same page with regard to the project idea). If we do have a conflict, we plan to resolve it by writing a random number generator code with each number from 0 to 3 referring to one particular teammate. The randomly generated number decides the winner.
