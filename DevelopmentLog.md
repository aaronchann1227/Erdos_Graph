# Progress Log


- During week 0 (week before submitting the project proposal) we decided on a project to calculate the Erdos Number of a mathematician using a graph which would use BFS and Djikstraâ€™s Algorithm for traversal and shortest path finding. We also came up with an equation to decide the weights for the graph. We then found our data set. 

- During week 1, we managed to find our data set, and using python were able to process it to c++. We then distributed the work among two teams. One consisting of Man Chong and Jerry Wu to work on the Graph Constructor. The other consisting of Raghav and Simon to work on the BFS. 

- During week 2, we made significant progress on the following : the graph constructor, the vertex and edge classes (to keep track of the mathematicians and publication in our Erdos number graph) and also chalked out a skeleton of the BFS traversal using two classes; BFS and Traversal.
